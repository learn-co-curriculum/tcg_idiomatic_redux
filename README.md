# Idiomatic Redux

## Learning Goals

- Use common coding patterns to write effective redux code

## Video Series

Dan Abramov's Redux Fundamentals course laid down the fundamentals of using redux to manage state in React Applications.
[Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) picks up where it left off. There are about 2.5 hours of videos. You should code along with the videos and get the examples to run - otherwise, it's easy to zone out and miss the point of a video, leading you to have to repeat the video.
